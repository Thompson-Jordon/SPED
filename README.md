###### by **Jordon Thompson**

## What is [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)?
* A query language for your API
  * Alternative to `REST` or `SOAP`
* Single endpoint
  * Databases
  * API's
  * GraphQL
* Strongly typed
* Get only what you want

## How to use [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)?
Download this repository and open a termina in the project file. Download the dependencies by running:
```

Once dependencies are installed your can start your program with:

you can connect to port `9000` on your machine or click this link:

[SPED GraphQL demo](http://localhost:9000)

Once your on the server you can check out the `DOCS` and `SCHEMA` tabs on the right.

## When to use [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)?

I found a great article on [Medium](https://medium.com/@JeffLombardJr/when-and-why-to-use-graphql-24f6bce4839d) that talks about when you should use [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). In short if you have an existing stable API you should probably leave it alone. 

Reasons of using GraphQL:
* Its easier
* It abstracts away data complexity.
* When you want to bring multiple data sources together into a single endpoint
